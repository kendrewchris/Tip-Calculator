## Project Description

Two text fields take user-inputted values corresponding to the bill sub-total and desired tip percentage respectively. Two buttons exist for the user to increment and decrement the number of people splitting the total bill. This single-page web application will immediately calculate and display the break-up of payments per person, upon each text field's population.
